Installation Specifications:

To install the modified AlexNet model and use it on a forked repository:

1. Go to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JWkOr_JJeIctnuLY0nxl2fYgXWo9yKoD?usp=sharing and download model.pth
2. Once model.pth is installed, add it to the backend directory in the project

Note: Currently, the frontend uses an ngrok link (inactive) that forwards to the port where our Flask server was running during development, so the code will need to be modified to the URL you are running the server on, with the endpoint '/upload'.
